# NeuralNetwork

Genetic algorithm is a part of evolutional computing, an optimization process, aim of which “is to
improve the ability of an organism to survive in dynamically changing and competitive environments”
(Gedeon, 2016). According to Gedeon (2016), the main components of an evolutional algorithm is an
encoding of the problem as a chromosome, a function to evaluate the fitness, or survival strength of
individuals, initialization of the initial population, selection operators and reproduction operators. In
this experiment, a neural network with different size of hidden layer can be considered as an individual.
The fitness function is calculating the prediction error of neural network with different topologies with
10th cross validation, built in my previous work (2016). In this paper, the two-layer perceptron and
three-layer perceptron will be discussed separately as before. The initial population size and max
generation size will be set by Matlab command line. Other parameters such as selection operators and
reproduction operators will be set as default.
